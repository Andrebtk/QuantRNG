# Quantum Random Number Generator (QuantRNG)

This project implements a Quantum Random Number Generator (RNG) using Qiskit, a quantum computing framework developed by IBM. The RNG leverages the principles of quantum mechanics and quantum entanglement to generate truly random numbers.

## Features

- Generates random numbers using a quantum circuit implemented in Qiskit.
- Utilizes quantum phenomena like superposition and measurement to ensure randomness.
- Supports customization from 0 to __
- [!] TO FIX -> can generate a number bigger 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the QuantRNG, you need to install the required dependencies:
 ```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Andrebtk/QuantRNG.git
   cd QuantRNG
   ```
2. Usage:
   ```bash
   python3 quantumRNG.py
   ```
   or for showing the circuit
   ```bash
   python3 quantumRNG.py -circuit
   ```
